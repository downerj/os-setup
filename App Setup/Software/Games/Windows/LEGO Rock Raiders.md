## Prerequesites
This guide is geared towards installing and running LEGO&reg; Rock Raiders on Windows 10 and 11. It has not been tested on Windows Vista, 7, 8 or 8.1.
<br/>
The original game was built for Windows 9x (95, 98, ME) and should also run on early versions of Windows NT (2000, XP).

### LEGO&reg; Rock Raiders
If you can find a physical CD-ROM to install and play this from, then that's great!
Otherwise, you can find the game on abandonware and archive websites:
- My Abandonware: [myabandonware.com/game/lego-rock-raiders-bci](https://www.myabandonware.com/game/lego-rock-raiders-bci)
- Internet Archive: [archive.org/details/LEGORockRaiders-gamefiles-Eng](https://archive.org/details/LEGORockRaiders-gamefiles-Eng)

### WinCDEmu
This is for mounting the game from cuesheet (.bin/.cue) files which contain the full game and audio data. If you're using an ISO-9660 optical disc image (.iso) file or a physical CD instead, then this software is not needed.
<br/>
Note that ISO-9660 optical disc image files can't store the audio data track which is encoded separately on the CD-ROM.
